A super shop management system data model is a blueprint or a representation of the various entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints involved in a super shop management system. The data model is used to organize and structure the data that is used in the system.

Here is an example of a data model for a super shop management system:

Customer entity:
Customer ID (primary key)
Name
Phone Number
Address
Product entity:
Product ID (primary key)
Name
Price
Quantity
Supplier ID (foreign key)
Supplier entity:
Supplier ID (primary key)
Name
Phone Number
Address
Sale entity:
Sale ID (primary key)
Customer ID (foreign key)
Date
Total amount
Sale details entity:
Sale detail ID (primary key)
Sale ID (foreign key)
Product ID (foreign key)
Quantity
Unit Price
User entity:
User ID (primary key)

Role
In this data model, there are six entities: customer, product, supplier, sale, sale details, and user. The entities are connected through primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between them. The data model allows the system to manage customer information, product information, supplier information, sale information, and user information.
